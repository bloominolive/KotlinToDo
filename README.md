# Overview

This was my first project using Kotlin and IntelliJ IDEA IDE! It was a lot of fun creating something new in an environment I hadn't used before. The Task
Manager is a simple program, but demonstrates my ability to code something new in a short amount of time with a new language and IDE. 

IntelliJ IDEA was a little different than the VSCode I am used to working in, but I found it intuitive and clean with a lot of great features that made coding feel fun and fresh.


My purpose for writing this software was to demonstrate my ability to research a new language and environment and execute a simple program showcasing the fundamental concepts of Kotlin.
The Task Manager is a command-line application that enables users to add, list, complete, and remove tasks, with persistent storage so tasks are saved between sessions. This project gave me hands-on experience with Kotlin's syntax, data structures, and file handling, as well as using IntelliJ IDEA's 
debugging and navigation tools to streamline my development process.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA IDE to develop this program. 

I used Kotlin, an object-oriented programming language developed by JetBrains, which is interoperable with Java and commonly used for Android development. Kotlin's concise syntax and support for both object-oriented and functional programming made it a good choice for my more general application.

In this project, I used the standard Kotlin library for handling tasks like file input/output and collections. The project was configured to run with JDK 11, and IntelliJ IDEAâ€™s Kotlin plugin was used for development, which provided useful features like code suggestions, debugging, and quick navigation.

# Future Work


- I think it would be awesome to give this a UI. I'd love to either convert it to Kotlin JS to use in the browser or work in the Android Developer IDE.
- A calendar feature on this would be really cool, especially if I could figure out how to do notifications that tasks are coming up.
- I could add subtasks so a task could be further broken down into smaller steps.
